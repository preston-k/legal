Sensitive user informaton includes, but is not limited to, emails, passwords, first name, last name, username, birthday, security question answers, billing information, and much more. Because we are unable to access the original data once it has been hashed, for forms that require for password, for example, hash the password you entered and compares it with the hashed password in our database.</p>
